<p>easy pizza recipe</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Yeast
Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise. </li>
  <li>Sugar
To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar</li>
  <li>Bread Flour
Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity. </li>
  <li>Olive Oil
Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess. </li>
  <li>Salt
A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise). </li>
</ul>


<h4>Preparation: </h4>

<ol>
  <li> Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
  <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. </li>
  <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
  <li>Let rest for 5 minutes. </li>
  <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle. </li>
  <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan. </li>
  <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice. </li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving. </li>
</ol>
